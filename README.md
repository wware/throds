# Threaded rod design tool

![Image of tetrahedron](/tetra.jpg?raw=true "Optional Title")

This is a software design tool for Rep-Rap-style construction using threaded rods
(cheaply available at many hardware stores, or online) and 3d-printed plastic blocks.
This is in a very early stage of development and likely to be buggy and cantankerous
and frankly a bit user-hostile.
